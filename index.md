I am interested in choice: specifically, how people go about making
choices.
My research programme extends the standard methods of economic
analysis by taking account that the _processes_ we use to make choices
can affect not only what choice gets made, but how we feel about the
outcomes of those choices as well.

Through the use of game theory, economists have recognised that
the choices made in groups can depend on details of process such as
timing and information.
A strand of my research contributes to the standard application of
game theory in economics and other disciplines, including via
my Open Source software package,
[Gambit: Software Tools for Game Theory](http://www.gambit-project.org).

My work incorporates a richer notion of process, which takes into
account the role that choice architecture, labeling, and social
context, among others, colour the choice process.
Previous funding for my work has come as part of the
[ESRC Network for Integrated Behavioural Science](http://www.behavioural-science.ac.uk),
under its theme _&quot;The science of consumer behaviour&quot;_,
and from an InnovateUK-funded Knowledge Transfer Partnership
with my colleague Rose Meleady (UEA Psychology) and Anglian Water,
to embed knowledge and capacity to develop,
implement and test behaviour change interventions.
